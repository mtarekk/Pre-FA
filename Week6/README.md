# Electronics Design

It was an exciting week as I design my very first PCB

Note about the group assignment:
I don't have group yet ðŸ˜­
___

## Design 
I start by exploring **KiCad**. It's interface is beginner friendly.

Then I download and install [Fab Library](https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/pub/libraries/electronics/kicad) in KiCad.

Then I got the components from the **Fab library** and connect them using labels to make it easy to trace what is connected where ^.^

It doesn't take me much time to connect everything together in the schematic. 

On the other hand it took me a couple of days to connect all the traces together and be satisfied about it also I used 0 ohm resistor as a bridge.

## Milling
 
I used **GerbV** to prepare my layers.

Then I used **Gimp** to edit the images.

Then I used **[Mods](https://mods.cba.mit.edu/)** to generate **G-Code**.

Then I used the China Router to mill my PCB

I Used 0.4mm V-bit to mill the traces and 1.2mm endmill bit for the outline.

## Programming

I didn't make **FabISP** so I used Arduino UNO and I used ArduinoISP sketch to program my hello world board

Then I added 

"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json"

to my Arduino IDE Preferences and then I install Attiny from boards manager

Then I set my communication settings as following:

I connect my attiny44 echo board to ArduinoIPS as following:

| **Attiny44** | **Arduino** |
|:----------:|:-----------:|
|     RST    |      10     |
|    MOSI    |      11     |
|    MISO    |      12     |
|     SCK    |      13     |
|     VCC    |      5V     |
|     GND    |     GND     |

## Testing

I made this simple code to test my PCB

```
#define SW 7
#define LED 8
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(SW, INPUT_PULLUP);
}

void loop() {
  if (digitalRead(SW) == LOW) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
      delay(1000);
      digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
      delay(1000);
    }
  } 
  else
  {
    digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
  }
}

```
